#Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
To create a repository on GitHub all you need to do click the "+ New Repository" button
#Describe what open source means.
Open source is practice that allows you to share how you made your computer program and also allow others to edit it.
#What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
I think its a great idea because others can improve upon what you have already made, or fix bugs that might be in your code. Open Source kinda makes me nervous because it is meet to be shared. I don't know if I would call this a utopia but its a good oppurtinity to see other peoples ideas/code.
#Assess the importance of using licenses.
Licenses are important because they prevent others from stealing or tell others that you may make this program your own. If there were not licenses everyone could take credit for something they didn't make.
#What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
One thing that was solidified in this challenge is how to do a pull request. The aha moment I had was how to make a commit. Took me about 10 tries to get it down, but I got it down in this challenge. I really struggled with a pull request showing up on GitHub.
#Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
No I did not. It was fairly easy to understand once I figured how everything worked.
